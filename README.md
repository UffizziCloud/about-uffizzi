# Uffizzi Cloud
This repository contains basic information about [Uffizzi Cloud](https://uffizzi.cloud).

## About
Uffizzi is a Docker-centric cloud platform that makes it Easy-like-Uffizzi to deploy and manage your applications and databases in the cloud. Deploy APIs, front-ends or full-stack applications direct from Docker Hub, then connect them to one of Uffizzi's fully managed database offerings.
